# Repolex Knowledge Graph of asimov-platform/release-action

RDF knowledge graph data for [asimov-platform/release-action](https://github.com/asimov-platform/release-action), parsed by [repolex](https://repolex.ai).

> **Note**: This data is experimental and subject to change without notice.

## How to use this data

The easiest way to get started is to install the [lexq](https://github.com/repolex-ai/lexq) query tool using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

If you have uv installed, just copy/paste this into your terminal:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/repolex-ai/lexq
```

This installs lexq onto your system, in your user context. Verify the install:

```bash
lexq --help
```

**lexq is designed to be used primarily by LLMs in a terminal.** Start up your favorite LLM and ask it to use the lexq tool. It's that easy!

To load this repo's data:

```bash
lexq download asimov-platform/release-action
```

This will automatically download essential data files from the last parsed commit. Consult `lexq --moreinfo` for other options, including downloading multiple commits, blobs, etc.

## Data structure

All data is stored as gzip-compressed [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/) (`.nq.gz`), a standard RDF format that can be loaded into any triplestore or graph database.

| Directory | What it contains |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `blob/` | Per-file AST graphs, content-addressed by git blob SHA. Each file in the source repo gets its own graph. |
| `aggregate/ast/` | Combined AST graph per parsed commit. Merges all blob graphs for a snapshot of the entire codebase at that point. |
| `aggregate/lsp/` | Language Server Protocol enrichment: resolved symbols, definitions, references, and type information. |
| `aggregate/dataflow/` | Interprocedural data flow edges between functions and modules. |
| `aggregate/repolex/` | Combined graph (AST + LSP + dataflow) per commit. |
| `commit/` | Git commit metadata (author, date, message, parent links). |
| `branch/` | Branch metadata. |
| `tag/` | Tag metadata. |
| `filetree/` | File tree snapshots per commit (which files existed and their blob SHAs). |
